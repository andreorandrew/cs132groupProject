Patch Notes Homework 16:
- Added exception classes to Character.h.
- Converted HeroCharacter into a class with Templates.
- Removed HeroCharater.cpp as function definitions are now in HeroCharacter.h.
- Added ability to create a custom character in main.cpp. This means that option 1 in the menu is no longer a "Coming Soon..."
- try/catch blocks added to handle exceptions in custom character creation.
